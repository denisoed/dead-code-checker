# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is currently at a stable state with a released version of 1.0.4. It provides a functional dead code checker for JavaScript and TypeScript projects with both CLI and programmatic API interfaces.

## Current State

- Core scanning engine is implemented and working
- CLI interface is functional with all necessary options
- API interface is available for programmatic use
- Support for multiple JavaScript frameworks is in place
- CI/CD integration is supported
- Recently expanded file type support to include additional JavaScript/TypeScript module formats (.mjs, .cjs, .mts, .cts)

## Recent Changes

- The project has been released as version 1.0.4
- Basic documentation is in place with README and examples
- NPM packaging is configured for distribution
- GitHub repository is set up with workflows
- Added support for additional JavaScript and TypeScript module file extensions (.mjs, .cjs, .mts, .cts)

## Active Decisions

1. **Detection Strategy**: Currently using regex-based pattern matching for code analysis
   - Pros: Lightweight, fast, no heavy dependencies
   - Cons: May have edge cases where complex syntax isn't properly detected
2. **File Filtering**: Using extension-based filtering with ignore patterns
   - Pros: Simple to understand and configure
   - Cons: May require additions as new file types become popular
3. **Report Format**: Simple CLI output with file paths, line numbers, and names
   - Pros: Easy to read and understand
   - Cons: May benefit from more structured output formats (JSON, HTML, etc.)
4. **File Extensions**: Focused on including all file types that may contain JavaScript/TypeScript code
   - Pros: Comprehensive coverage of code files
   - Cons: May need regular updates as new formats emerge

## Current Challenges

1. **False Positives**: Some legitimate code patterns may be flagged as dead code
2. **Complex Syntax**: Advanced JavaScript patterns might not be properly detected
3. **Performance**: Large codebases may take significant time to analyze
4. **Framework-Specific Features**: Some framework-specific patterns may require special handling

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Gather user feedback on detection accuracy
2. Consider potential optimizations for large codebases
3. Add support for additional file types if needed
4. Refine detection algorithms to reduce false positives
5. Consider adding structured output formats (JSON, HTML)

## Open Questions

1. Should the tool use AST parsing for more accurate detection?
2. Are there additional frameworks or file types that need special handling?
3. Would a visual report format be beneficial for users?
4. Could the performance be improved for large codebases?
