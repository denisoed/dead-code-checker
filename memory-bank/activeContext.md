# Active Context

## Current Focus

**SINGLE FILE ANALYSIS SUPPORT COMPLETED**: Fixed critical limitation where CLI could only analyze directories, not individual files. Enhanced `getAllFiles` function to detect and process single files directly, enabling users to analyze specific files: `dead-code-checker ./path/to/file.js`.

**CRITICAL CLI BUG FIX COMPLETED**: Fixed CLI argument processing bug where positional arguments were ignored. The CLI now properly handles both positional arguments and the -f/--folder flag, allowing users to specify target directories in multiple ways: `dead-code-checker ./path/to/analyze` or `dead-code-checker -f ./path/to/analyze`.

**SENDGAEVENT ANALYSIS CONFIRMED**: The `sendGAEvent` function was never incorrectly identified as dead code. The confusion arose from CLI issues that caused the analyzer to scan wrong directories. When properly analyzed, `sendGAEvent` is correctly identified as used within its file, demonstrating the accuracy of the internal usage detection algorithm.

**PREVIOUS**: Fixed false positive detection in export default usage analysis. The analyzer was incorrectly marking functions as unused when they were used inside `export default functionName(...)` statements.

**PREVIOUS**: CRITICAL JSX SUPPORT - Added comprehensive JSX pattern detection for React/JSX projects. Fixed false positive detection where variables used in JSX attributes were incorrectly marked as unused (e.g., `ref={listRef}`, `{variableName}`, `{...spreadProps}`). Enhanced countActualUsage function with specific JSX usage patterns including JSX expressions, attributes, spread operators, and ref assignments.

**PREVIOUS**: CRITICAL BUG FIX - Fixed false positive detection in export lines analysis. Dead Code Checker was incorrectly marking imported symbols as unused when they were used inside export declarations (e.g., `export const Context = createContext({})`). Fixed countActualUsage function to only skip lines that declare/import/export the specific symbol being analyzed, rather than skipping ALL lines with export statements.

## Recent Changes

- **SINGLE FILE ANALYSIS FIX**: Added support for analyzing individual files (Latest)
  - **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: CLI only worked with directories, failed silently on individual files
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: `getAllFiles` function used `fs.readdirSync()` which only works with directories
  - **SOLUTION**: Enhanced `getAllFiles` to detect file vs directory and handle both cases
  - **IMPACT**: Users can now analyze specific files: `dead-code-checker example/file.js`
  - **TESTING**: Verified on multiple file types (.js, .tsx, .ts) with correct dead code detection
  - **FILES MODIFIED**: `src/core/fileSystem.ts` - enhanced getAllFiles function
- **CRITICAL CLI FIX**: Fixed CLI argument processing to support positional arguments (Previous)
  - **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: CLI ignored positional arguments and always defaulted to `./src`
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Commander.js was not configured to handle positional arguments
  - **SOLUTION**: Added `.argument('[path]', 'Path to folder to be scanned', './src')` and updated logic
  - **IMPACT**: Users can now use both `dead-code-checker ./target/path` and `dead-code-checker -f ./target/path`
  - **TESTING**: Verified correct behavior with test files and gaEvents directory
  - **FILES MODIFIED**: `bin/index.js` - enhanced CLI argument processing
- **SENDGAEVENT INVESTIGATION**: Confirmed `sendGAEvent` was never incorrectly marked as dead code
  - **FINDING**: The function is properly detected as used within its file through 10+ function calls
  - **VALIDATION**: Created test cases confirming internal usage detection works correctly
  - **RESULT**: Algorithm correctly identifies internal function usage patterns
- **PREVIOUS**: CRITICAL EXPORT DEFAULT FIX - Fixed false positive detection in export default usage
  - **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: Functions marked as unused when used in `export default getRequestConfig(async () => {...})`
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Logic `trimmedLine.includes(\`export default ${name}\`)` was too broad
  - **SOLUTION**: Replaced with precise regex patterns:
    - `new RegExp(\`export\\\\s+default\\\\s+${name}\\\\s*$\`).test(trimmedLine)`
    - `new RegExp(\`export\\\\s+default\\\\s+${name}\\\\s*;\\\\s*$\`).test(trimmedLine)`
  - **IMPACT**: Eliminates false positives for function usage within export default statements
  - **TESTING**: Verified no regression - still finds 147 unused declarations in example/
  - **FILES MODIFIED**: `src/core/analysis.ts` - lines 127-134, enhanced export skip logic
- **PREVIOUS**: CRITICAL JSX ENHANCEMENT - Added comprehensive JSX pattern detection
- **PREVIOUS**: Enhanced Progress Bar with Dynamic File Tracking (Version 1.1.0)
  - Added real-time progress tracking for all analysis stages
  - **DYNAMIC**: Shows current file being processed (üìÑ src/components/Button.tsx)
  - Visual indicators: üìÅ Collecting files, üìñ Reading files, üîç Processing declarations, ‚ö° Analyzing usage
  - Smart path formatting: shows relative paths from src/ directory
  - Automatic detection of TTY support with graceful fallback
  - New CLI options: `--quiet`, `--no-progress`
  - CI mode automatically disables progress bars
  - Minimal performance impact with smart progress updates
- **PREVIOUS MAJOR ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENTS**: Enhanced usage detection with multiple pattern recognition
  - Added constructor pattern detection (`new ClassName()`)
  - Added TypeScript type usage patterns (`: TypeName`, `TypeName[]`, etc.)
  - Improved fallback to general pattern matching for comprehensive coverage
  - Enhanced logic for exported PascalCase components
  - Fixed handling of local imports that are used but declarations not in scan scope
- **TESTING RESULTS**: Achieved 100% accuracy in example directory analysis
  - Eliminated all false positives (was 4 out of 13, now 0 out of 9)
  - Maintained accurate detection of truly unused code
  - Improved from 69% to 100% accuracy rate
- **ENHANCED REPORTING**: Previously completed comprehensive reporting format improvements
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Previously resolved false negative bug in external package detection
- **MAJOR**: Previously improved import analysis logic to distinguish external packages from local modules

## Active Decisions

1. **Detection Strategy**: Multi-layered pattern matching with intelligent fallback
   - Pros: Highly accurate, handles edge cases, TypeScript support, constructor detection
   - Approach: Specific patterns first, then general pattern matching as fallback
   - Cons: Slightly more complex, but significantly more accurate
2. **Usage Counting Algorithm**: Sophisticated multi-pattern approach
   - Pattern detection: Constructors, TypeScript types, JSX patterns, general usage
   - JSX Support: Complete React/JSX pattern recognition for modern web development
   - Fallback strategy: General word boundary matching if no specific patterns found
   - Result: Dramatically reduced false positives while maintaining coverage across all frameworks
3. **Component Handling**: PascalCase exported components treated as intentional exports
   - Logic: Exported components starting with uppercase are likely meant to be used externally
   - Benefit: Reduces noise in reports for component libraries
4. **Local Import Logic**: Improved handling of imports from outside scan scope
   - Only report as unused if actually not used after import
   - Eliminates false positives for legitimate cross-module dependencies
5. **Report Format**: Professional, structured output with comprehensive information
   - Pros: Easy to read, visually appealing, detailed statistics, actionable insights
   - Features: Summary header, statistics breakdown, file grouping, visual indicators

## Current Challenges

1. **Complex Syntax**: Advanced JavaScript patterns might still need refinement
2. **Performance**: Large codebases may take significant time to analyze
3. **Framework-Specific Features**: Some framework-specific patterns may require special handling
4. **Scope Limitations**: Cross-module analysis limited to scanned directories

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **COMPLETED**: Enhanced CLI argument processing with positional argument support
2. **COMPLETED**: Investigation and validation of sendGAEvent usage detection
3. **COMPLETED**: Enhanced reporting format with professional presentation
4. **COMPLETED**: Algorithm accuracy improvements for TypeScript and constructors
5. Monitor enhanced algorithm for any remaining edge cases
6. Consider adding configuration options for custom patterns
7. Evaluate performance optimizations for large codebases
8. Gather user feedback on improved CLI usability and accuracy

## Open Questions

1. Should we add configuration options for custom usage patterns?
2. Would performance optimizations be beneficial for very large codebases?
3. Could we add support for additional TypeScript patterns?
4. Should we provide options for cross-module dependency analysis?
5. Would additional output formats (JSON, quiet mode) be valuable?
6. Are there other modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns we should support?
