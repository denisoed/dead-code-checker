# Active Context

## Current Focus

Successfully implemented improvements to import analysis to distinguish external packages from local modules. This resolved the false positive issue where external npm packages like `clsx` were incorrectly flagged as dead code.

## Current State

- Core scanning engine is implemented and working
- CLI interface is functional with all necessary options
- API interface is available for programmatic use
- Support for multiple JavaScript frameworks is in place
- CI/CD integration is supported
- **NEW**: Enhanced import analysis that correctly handles external packages
- Recently expanded file type support to include additional JavaScript/TypeScript module formats (.mjs, .cjs, .mts, .cts)

## Recent Changes

- **MAJOR**: Improved import analysis logic to distinguish external packages from local modules
  - External packages (like `react`, `clsx`, `lodash`) are no longer flagged as dead code
  - Local imports (relative paths, path aliases) continue to be properly analyzed
  - Added `isExternalPackage()` function to identify npm packages vs local modules
- Updated data structures to store import source information
- Enhanced `isDeadCode()` logic to handle external packages correctly
- Added comprehensive tests for external package detection
- Fixed TypeScript compilation and Jest configuration for testing

## Active Decisions

1. **Detection Strategy**: Currently using regex-based pattern matching for code analysis
   - Pros: Lightweight, fast, no heavy dependencies
   - Cons: May have edge cases where complex syntax isn't properly detected
2. **Import Analysis Enhancement**: Now distinguishes between external packages and local modules
   - External packages: Identified by import paths that don't start with '.', '/', or '@/'
   - Local modules: Analyzed for dead code as before
   - Significantly reduced false positives
3. **File Filtering**: Using extension-based filtering with ignore patterns
   - Pros: Simple to understand and configure
   - Cons: May require additions as new file types become popular
4. **Report Format**: Simple CLI output with file paths, line numbers, and names
   - Pros: Easy to read and understand
   - Cons: May benefit from more structured output formats (JSON, HTML, etc.)

## Current Challenges

1. **Complex Syntax**: Advanced JavaScript patterns might not be properly detected
2. **Performance**: Large codebases may take significant time to analyze
3. **Framework-Specific Features**: Some framework-specific patterns may require special handling

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Gather user feedback on the improved detection accuracy
2. Consider potential optimizations for large codebases
3. Add support for additional file types if needed
4. Consider adding structured output formats (JSON, HTML)
5. Monitor for edge cases in external package detection

## Open Questions

1. Should the tool use AST parsing for more accurate detection?
2. Are there additional frameworks or file types that need special handling?
3. Would a visual report format be beneficial for users?
4. Could the performance be improved for large codebases?
5. Should we add configuration options for custom external package patterns?
