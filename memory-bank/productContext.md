# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Managing large codebases often leads to accumulated dead code - functions and variables that were once used but are now obsolete. This dead code:

- Increases cognitive load for developers
- Makes codebases harder to maintain
- Creates confusion about what code is actually being used
- Increases bundle sizes in web applications
- Makes refactoring more difficult and error-prone

Without automated tools, identifying dead code requires manual inspection, which is time-consuming and error-prone, especially in large projects.

## User Needs

Developers and engineering teams need:

1. A simple way to detect unused code across their codebase
2. Pinpoint identification of where dead code exists (file and line number)
3. The ability to integrate dead code checking into CI/CD pipelines
4. Support for modern JavaScript frameworks and development patterns
5. Minimal configuration and setup to get started

## User Experience Goals

- **Simple Command Line Interface**: Quick to learn and use
- **Minimal Setup**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
- **Clear Reporting**: Easy-to-understand output highlighting dead code
- **Configurable**: Ability to ignore specific functions, variables, or directories
- **Adaptable**: Works with various JavaScript/TypeScript project structures
- **CI/CD Ready**: Special mode to exit with non-zero status when dead code is found

## Target Users

- JavaScript/TypeScript developers
- Frontend development teams
- Backend Node.js developers
- DevOps engineers integrating code quality checks
- Technical leads responsible for code quality

## Value Proposition

Dead Code Checker helps development teams:

- Maintain cleaner, more maintainable codebases
- Reduce bundle sizes in production applications
- Streamline code reviews by eliminating confusion over unused code
- Automate the detection of obsolete code that should be removed
- Improve developer productivity by reducing cognitive load
