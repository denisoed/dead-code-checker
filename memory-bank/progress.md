# Progress

## Completed Work

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Main `DeadCodeChecker` class implementation
- ✅ File system traversal with configurable filters
- ✅ Function and variable detection algorithms
- ✅ Usage counting and dead code identification
- ✅ Report generation
- ✅ **NEW**: Enhanced import analysis that distinguishes external packages from local modules

### User Interfaces

- ✅ CLI implementation with Commander.js
- ✅ API interface for programmatic use
- ✅ Configurable options for both interfaces
- ✅ Colored terminal output for better readability
- ✅ CI/CD integration with exit code support

### Project Infrastructure

- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Build process with Rollup
- ✅ Multiple distribution formats (CJS, ESM, UMD)
- ✅ TypeScript declarations for type safety
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Comprehensive test suite with external package detection tests
- ✅ NPM packaging
- ✅ GitHub repository setup
- ✅ Documentation (README, examples)

### Recent Major Improvements

- ✅ **MAJOR ENHANCEMENT**: Improved import analysis to eliminate false positives for external packages
  - External npm packages (react, clsx, lodash, etc.) are no longer flagged as dead code
  - Local imports continue to be properly analyzed for actual dead code
  - Added `isExternalPackage()` utility function
  - Enhanced data structures to store import source information
  - Updated `isDeadCode()` logic with sophisticated external package handling
- ✅ Extended file type support to include modern JavaScript/TypeScript module formats (.mjs, .cjs, .mts, .cts)
- ✅ Fixed Jest configuration for proper TypeScript testing support
- ✅ Added ts-jest for testing TypeScript code

## In Progress

- 🔄 Gathering user feedback for further refinements
- 🔄 Testing with various project structures and frameworks

## Planned Work

- 📝 Add performance optimizations for large codebases
- 📝 Consider adding support for additional file types as needed
- 📝 Explore alternative output formats (JSON, HTML)
- 📝 Expand test coverage for edge cases
- 📝 Add more comprehensive examples
- 📝 Consider configuration options for custom external package patterns

## Resolved Issues

1. ✅ **False positives for external packages** - Major issue resolved
   - External packages were incorrectly flagged as dead code
   - Implemented smart detection to distinguish external vs local imports
   - Significantly improved accuracy and user experience

## Known Issues

1. Some complex code patterns may lead to false positives (reduced significantly)
2. Performance may degrade with very large codebases
3. Certain framework-specific patterns might require special handling
4. Circular dependencies between files could affect detection accuracy

## Success Metrics

- The tool is published on NPM and can be installed globally
- Version 1.0.5 includes major improvements to import analysis
- CLI and API interfaces work as expected
- Documentation provides clear usage instructions
- Basic examples demonstrate functionality
- Supports all major JavaScript and TypeScript file formats
- **NEW**: Dramatically reduced false positives for external package imports
- **NEW**: Comprehensive test coverage for external package detection

## Next Milestone

- Release version 1.1.0 with the enhanced import analysis
- Add performance optimizations
- Support additional output formats
